Black Squadron: remnants of the rebellion

Intro:
  An extreme right wing party dominates the galactic government for years, opposition has often been imprisoned most know their 
  the only reason they remain in government is for show. The rebellion (formed by the oppositional party)finds support among the
  outer rim planets, among them a strange and unsual assortment of people . (the soon to be black squadron) An elite group formed 
  from the best of the outer rim regiments plays a key role in the govermental shift.
  
  The main character is a fighter pilot with synathesia (he sees procedural patterns and colors which helps predict enemy behaviours
  and makes him one of the best fighter pilots in the galaxy).
  
Scene One:
  The decisive battle (the government are about to be overthrown and sent on the run)... explosions, epic epicness, micheal bay etc.
  As soon as the shift is seen by the higher ups the order is sent out to dispose of the outer rim regiments. In order to sway 
  political favour of the people the outer rim regiments were ordered to state they would reduce tax rates. This is condemned by 
  the new government as the costs of war are too great and cause a galactic recession. 
  
Scene Two:
  having narrowly escaped, the once elite taskforce now labeled a false army they must find their way in this world...
  the limited goverment finaces have forced cut backs on enforcement across the galaxy, crime rates surge and the era of
  space piracy begins. the legend of the black squadron is born
